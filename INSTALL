ASITHAPPENS INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS


Prerequisites (Unix and Windows)
=============

A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 6 or higher must be installed


Installation options
====================

Four installation options are available:
- Unix with installer (".sh" file)
- Windows with installer (".exe" file)
- Unix without installer (".tgz" or ".zip" file)
- Windows without installer (".tgz" or ".zip" file)

If you are upgrading from a previous version, you can install over the top of the
previous installation directory.  If you have made your own additions to the
"asithappens.properties" file, You may want to back this up before the install, and
restore it afterwards.

The next section details how to install each of the four options.


Unix with installer (".sh" file)
===================

1. If it is not already there, add the Java 1.5 executable directory to your PATH
   environment variable e.g.
   PATH=$PATH:/opt/jdk1.5.0_06/bin

2. Run the installer and follow instructions e.g. with the command
   sh asithappens-0.40.sh


Windows with installer (".exe" file)
======================

1. Double-click on the installer file and follow instructions


Unix without installer (".tgz" or ".zip" file)
======================

1. Unpack the install file into any destination directory e.g. unpacking in /opt
   will create the application directory /opt/asithappens

2. Change the JAVA_EXE variable to the path to your JRE 1.5 executable
   (e.g. /opt/jdk1.5.0_06/jre/bin/java) in the script "bin/asithappens.sh"

3. Change the ASITHAPPENS_HOME variable to the install directory (e.g. /opt/asithappens)
   in the script "bin/asithappens.sh"

Use the "bin/asithappens.sh" script to start the application.


Windows without installer (".tgz" or ".zip" file)
=========================

1. Unpack the install file into any destination directory e.g. unpacking in "C:\Program Files"
   will create the application directory "C:\Program Files\asithappens"

2. Change the "javaExe" variable to the path to your JRE 1.5 executable
   (e.g. C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.5.0_04\bin\java") in the script "bin\asithappens.vbs"

3. Change the "asithappensHome" variable to the install directory
   (e.g. C:\Program Files\asithappens) in the script "bin\asithappens.vbs"

Use the "bin\asithappens.vbs" script to start the application.

NB - a problem has been reported with the VBS file not working under some Windows environments,
so a batch file is included as an alternative.  To use this, apply steps 2 and 3 above to the
script file "bin\asithappens.bat" instead, and use this script to start the application.


Upgrading
=========

To upgrade, you can either:
1. Run the installer and specify an existing directory of an older installation
2. Install into a new directory, and copy your existing "asithappens.properties" file from the
   old "config" directory into the "config" directory of your new installation
   

Configuration
=============

There are three properties files in the "config" directory:
1. defaults.properties
2. asithappens.properties
3. log4j.properties

The "defaults.properties" are system defaults and is generally best left as is.  It does
give you an idea of various configuration settings available.

The "asithappens.properties" settings override the defaults file, so any configuration
changes you wish to make should be made in this file.

The "log4j.properties" is used for application logging/debugging, and need not concern
most users.
