AsItHappens Usage Tips (version 0.59)
======================

Here are some usage tips for AsItHappens:

Configuration
=============
- AsItHappens used to be somewhat usable without a database - this is no longer the case
- the embedded "H2" database is now included with AsItHappens and used by default
- the MySQL database option will possibly be removed at some point in the future
- the embedded H2 database requires no manual set up, so should always be available
- the database schema changes significantly in the 0.40 release - backward compatibility is not
  maintained at present
- the "defaults.properties" and "asithappens.properties" files contains some options that AsItHappens
  reads at start-up
- properties in "asithappens.properties" override those in "default.properties" so it is recommended
  that you put all your desired modifications into "asithappens.properties" and leave "default.properties"
  as is
- AsItHappens must be restarted for any new properties file settings to take effect

General usage
=============
- double-click on a graph to create a text label for that part of the graph
- press "o" on a graph to produce a set of changeable graph properties
- press "l" on a graph to produce a list of any text labels defined - you can delete labels from here
- press "d" on a graph to show the underlying graph data - mainly for debugging
- press "s" on a graph to show summary statistics for the data displayed in the current graph view
- press "n" on a graph to Defend Your Network
- AsItHappens can poll on some graph types in the order of milliseconds.  This has the potential to hose
  your network if you're too aggresive.  The good thing is that with AsItHappens you'll be able measure
  exactly _how_ badly you've hosed your network.
- Due to varying support of the SNMPv3 privacy protocols in devices, when having problems using SNMPv3 AuthPriv,
  you might try falling back to a weaker encryption algorithm, as these usually have better device support.

Response collection
===================
- response information can be collected from any device that can respond to ICMP echo requests (ping)
- there are two response collection options, one that can be used on any platform ("generic"), and one that can
  only be used when AsItHappens runs on Windows ("windows")
- you can change the collector used in the "asithappens.properties" file using either of the following lines:
     collector.response.class = generic
     collector.response.class = windows
- the "windows" collector is guaranteed to use ICMP for response collection
- the "generic" collector uses a Java method (isReachable) that uses ICMP if it can, but uses TCP echo if ICMP
  is unavailable
- under Unix, the "generic" collector will probably use TCP echo unless AsItHappens is run as the root user,
  since ICMP sockets are generally only available to root
- a timeout is represented by a value of half the polling interval

Bandwidth collection
====================
- bandwidth collection requires SNMP read-only access
- default collection uses the 32-bit counters from the standard MIB-2 interface table (ifTable), which are
  available on most SNMP-capable devices
- if selected by checkbox, collection can use 64-bit counters from the ifXTable - this requires the device
  to support SNMPv2c AND to include the 64-bit counters (ifHCInOctets/ifHCOutOctets) within the ifXTable
- collecting from 64-bit counters is useful when analyzing high-throughput interfaces, to avoid wrapping of
  32-bit counters, however a number of devices I have observed do not update the 64-counters as frequently
  as they do the 32-bit counters, hence even if the 64-bit counters are available, they do not necessarily
  produce the best results - because of this I have left the use of 64-bit counters as an interface option
- the Net-SNMP "snmpd" agent seems to default to caching interface statistics for 15 seconds - to disable this
  behaviour use the command:
     snmpset -v 2c -c private hostname nsCacheTimeout.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2 = 0
- SNMP interface counters on some Cisco routers don't update very quickly - some platform accept this undocumented
  command to adjust the update frequency of the SNMP variables (update interval is in hundredths of a second):
     snmp-server hc poll <update-interval>
- if you are using a 1.5 JRE, enumerating ports won't work unless you put this line in your
  asithappens.properties file:
     device.ports.ifalias = 0

Host collection
===============
- there are three different MIB locations available to collect processor and memory usage information from:
  Host Resources, Net-SNMP and Cisco (select the appropriate one from the drop-down menu)
- some collection types require resource enumeration and selection, but you will be prompted for this where
  appropriate
- all of these collection types requires SNMP read-only access

NBAR collection
===============
- NBAR (Network Based Application Response) is a Cisco technology only available on Cisco routers that breaks
  traffic into a fixed set of protocol groups, storing per-protocol statistics
- NBAR collection only works on Cisco routers with IOS version of 12.2(15)T or greater
- the NBAR collector requires SNMP read-write access - a read-only string will fail
- for NBAR to work, you first need to configure "ip nbar protocol-discovery" on the target interface
- you can create multiple NBAR collection sessions against the same device concurrently

Netflow collection
==================
- NetFlow is a Cisco technology only available on Cisco routers that categorizes traffic into "flow records",
  storing per-flow statistics
- NetFlow collection only works on Cisco routers with IOS version 12.3(11)T or greater
- the Netflow collector requires SNMP read-write access - a read-only string will fail
- CEF (Cisco Express Forwarding) should be enabled on the router to ensure complete collection of Netflow statistics
- the collector reconfigures Netflow on the selected router interface if necessary, and attempts to restore
  the original state of Netflow when the collection is finished (i.e. when the graph is closed)
- it is not recommended that you create multiple NetFlow collection sessions against the same
  device concurrently
- the format for Netflow legend values is as follows:
    ip_protocol[tos_byte] src_address(src_port) -> dst_address(dst_port)
- the "Categorize by" options enable you to group similar flows as part of a single data set
- the "Match Criteria" enable you to specify only certain flows to analyze

Accounting collection
=====================
- only Cisco accounting collection is supported
- three types of accounting information are supported: IP accounting, IP precedence accounting, and MAC accounting
- all accounting configuration must be done separately via CLI with the "ip accounting" interface command
- IP accounting can be collected in two ways - active and checkpoint - use only one at a time on any device
- only IP accounting checkpoint database collection requires read-write access; all others use read-only

OID collection
==============
- ensure that the SNMP type for each OID is specified correctly
- only Integer32, Counter32 and Counter64 SNMP types are supported

Capture
=======
- the "Capture" function can be run against a packet capture (e.g. created from tcpdump) - AsItHappens can
  not create capture files itself
- the "Fetch boundary times" simply fills in the dates/times for the start and end of the capture file 
- the "Categorize by" options enable you to group similar flows as part of a single data set
- the y-axis scale is now "bits per second"

Layouts
=======
- layouts are collections of graphs
- the "current layout" (i.e. the current collection of graphs) can be saved as a newly named layout
- the current layout can also overwrite an existing layout selected from the layout list
- when a previously saved layout is restored, AsItHappens loads the stored graphs without closing down
  existing graph windows
- only "collector" graphs are supported for inclusion in layouts at present; retrieved "sessions"
  and capture graphs are excluded
