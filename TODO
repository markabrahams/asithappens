NEW FEATURES
Auto-discovery of SNMP type from custom OID collector
Graphing of negative values (for custom OIDs)
Saving graph templates
Non-zero graph origin (graph bottom fixing, auto scaling for negative values)
Add internationalization (suggested by Thierry Uso)
Add French translation (suggested by Thierry Uso)
Add SNMPv3 support (suggested by George)
Implement MAC address accounting polling (suggested by Kristian Larsson)
Add export/import function for database transfer to another host (suggested by Karl Bousader)
Add minimum polling interval config option (suggested by Carlos Sola)
Add other interface variables e.g. packets per second, errors
Add option to force deletion of collecting session (suggested by Paul Cainkar)
Implement CBWFQ MIB polling
Add Debian package creation
Add storage of all sessions by default (as config option)
NBAR polling to eliminate averaging effects (use AllStatsTable with GetBulk?)
Add ability to use "protocols", "services" and "hosts" files for resolution
Add creation of labels directly on graph panel
Add renaming of labels via double-click on graph panel
Add drag-and-drop to move labels
Add right-click deletion of labels
Add perpetual file polling and graphing for packet capture graphs


BUG FIXES
Graph panel not correctly callibrated with y-axis
JVM crash in Self Defending Network when sound is enabled
Crash when opening some capture files over a Windows DFS share
Crash when handling out-of-bounds dates for capture graph
Out-of-memory crash when graphing large capture files
Net-SNMP processor data stops collecting except for "User" set
Adding labels to multiple graphs for same session produces inconsistency with database labels
NetFlow destination address mask setting doesn't do anything (looks like an IOS bug)
No NBAR capability checking during NBAR collector initialization
Resizing graphs of large packet captures causes application to freeze for a long time
Clicking on the database tab after application has been open a long time produces an error (reported by Abigail Whyld)
NullPointerException when opening two packet capture graphs concurrently
No storing of read community in Host panel


TIDYING
Document all classes using javadoc
Implement unit testing framework using JUnit
Implement application logging across all classes using log4j
Implement "GETBULK" method for more efficient SNMP table retrieval
Introduce collector table into Database to model DataCollector object
Investigate SNMPException types


NOT FIXING
Enforce referential integrity across database
Replacement of Date/Time fields in database/capture panels with JFormattedTextField - prefer simple text interface
